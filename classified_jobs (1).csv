Thales Belgium invites passionate and talented students for an exciting internship in the Innovation Department , where YOU get to choose your area of interest!1st Internship Topic : Developing the reward functionContext:This research is based on pre-existent work centred on reinforcement learning within multi-agent environments. The proposed challenge is that of designing effective reward functions to accurately guide the algorithm learning process. As the project background is based on decision aid for land collaborative combat, the design of the reward functions needs to take into consideration the collaborative nature of the agents, not just individual goals.Goal:The primary goal of this research is to develop a robust and effective reward function for reinforcement learning algorithms specifically tailored for decision support in collaborative combat.2nd Internship Topic : Research the probabilistic nature of situational awareness and develop a framework that quantifies uncertainty and explores new ways to improve decision making based on itContext:Situational Awareness is a critical component with applicability in varied fields such as military, aviation, emergency responses etc. it is traditionally comprised of perception, comprehension and projection of an environmentÂ¡Â¯s state, and is fundamental in the decision-making process (from perception to performance of action).Focused on the military operations field, this research into situational awareness is meant to delve into the probabilistic nature of situational awareness to further design decision aid models that take uncertainty and variability into account.Goal:Investigate the probabilistic aspects of situational awareness and their implications for decision-making in complex environments (military operations).Develop a framework that quantifies the uncertainty associated with situational awareness and explores how probabilistic models can enhance our understanding of cognitive processes in dynamic settings.3rd Internship Topic : Research state-of-the-art in scientific literature and based on it develop a validation methodology for decision support algorithms (in the context of collaborative combat operations)Context:Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with its environment and maximize cumulative rewards over time. Based on this logic, one of the fields of applicability for RL is in military operations Â¨C namely for decision support models.Goal:Develop a validation framework for decision support RL algorithms used for collaborative combat scenarios.The validation methodology should exhaustively take into consideration the following elements, but is not limited to these:Establish performance metricsTest scenariosMeasure stabilityDetermine and assess risksWhat YouÂ¡Â¯ll Experience:Collaborate with seasoned professionals on groundbreaking R&D projects.Get hands-on with industry-leading tools and technologies in your chosen field.Participate in innovative brainstorming sessions that encourage your ideas.Contribute to real-world applications that make a difference globally.What We Offer:A unique opportunity with a leading company in aerospace, defense, and secure communication.Mentoring from experienced engineers dedicated to your growth.A vibrant and inclusive workplace that celebrates diversity and innovation.The chance to make a real impact on projects that shape the future.Who You Are:A current student pursuing a degree in Data & AI, Computer Science, Engineering or a related discipline.Eager to learn and explore various engineering domains.A problem-solver with a knack for creativity and teamwork.Ready to embrace challenges and make meaningful contributions.How It Works:After reviewing your application, we will send you a form to fill where you will be able to specify the topic of your choice together with some administrative questions regarding the internship.At Thales we provide CAREERS and not only jobs.

68,68,Internship/Stage - Hardware Engineering - Quantum Optics,Thales,"Location: Tubize, BelgiumThales people architect solutions at the heart of the defence-security continuum. Interoperable and secure information and telecommunications systems for defence, security, and civil operators, are based upon innovative use of radiocommunications, networks, and cybersecurity. We are ground breaking new digital technologies such as 4G/5G mobile communications, cryptography, cloud computing and big data for use in physical protection systems, and critical information systems.Thales Belgium SA, Belgium competence center of Thales, is a company located on 2 sites, one in Tubize (near Brussels) and the other one in Herstal (near LiÂ¨Â¨ge). Thales Belgium, which employs more than 280 collaborators, is specialized in the design, development and supply of critical information systems for customers in the sectors of Defense, Security (including Cyber) and Aerospace.This document outlines the proposal for a six-month internship opportunity at Thales Belgium (TBE) in the Hardware Department. The purpose of this internship is to provide a framework of the activities to be carried out, define the goals, and set the expectations for the student and the company. More precisely, the Hardware Department at Thales Belgium is seeking exceptional students in Physics to join our team for a six-month internship. This internship will focus on improving a Python code [1] used for simulating several complex phenomena related to Rydberg physics in alkaline earth atoms. The intern will be involved in enhancing the code to simulate:Alkali Rydberg States and Stark Maps:Computation of highly-excited atomic states and their energy shifts under external electric fields.Pair-State Interactions for Alkaline Earths:Modeling the interactions between pairs of Rydberg atoms, which is crucial for understanding entanglement and other quantum effects.Perturbative van der Waals C6 Calculations:Calculations within manifolds of energy-degenerate states to understand long-range interatomic forces.Inter-Species Pair-State Calculations:Simulating interactions between different types of atoms in Rydberg states to explore multi-species systems.Sensitivity analysis :Simulating the sensitivity of Rydberg atom based sensors to electromagnetic fields.Background on Rydberg PhysicsRydberg physics is a field focused on highly-excited electronic states where an electron orbits far from the nucleus, creating atoms that are exceptionally large and sensitive to external influences. These ""gentle giants"" of atomic physics have unusual properties:High Energy and Long Lifetimes:Rydberg atoms are created with high energy and have longer lifetimes compared to other atomic states.Large Size and Sensitivity:Their large size makes them extremely sensitive to their environment, allowing even a single photon to affect the behavior of numerous Rydberg atoms over observable distances under an optical microscope.Common Characteristics:Whether in atoms, molecules, or solids, Rydberg states exhibit features that are well described by the Rydberg formula, which outlines the energy levels of highly-excited hydrogen atoms.Internship Focus: Electromagnetic Field Sensing Using Rydberg AtomsThe primary focus of this internship will be on the simulation of electromagnetic-field sensing using Rydberg atoms in vapor cells. The goal is to improve the simulation's capability to predict the sensitivity of Rydberg atoms to external electromagnetic fields, with the ultimate aim of developing ultra-wideband sensors. These sensors could have applications in fields such as telecommunications, security, and scientific research.Key elements of this research include:Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) Spectroscopy:This is a nondestructive optical detection technique used to detect signals from Rydberg atoms in the gas phase. EIT has been successfully implemented in both cold atomic gases and room-temperature vapor cells, making it a versatile tool for studying Rydberg states.Simulation of Sensitivity to Electromagnetic Fields:The intern will work on simulating the response of Rydberg atoms to various electromagnetic field conditions, exploring their potential as ultra-sensitive detectors that can operate across a wide range of frequencies.Expected OutcomesBy the end of the internship, the student is expected to achieve the following:Enhancement of Simulation Code:Improve the existing Python code to enhance its accuracy, efficiency, and scope for simulating Rydberg physics phenomena.Development of New Algorithms:Develop and implement algorithms for simulating new types of interactions or field effects that have not yet been explored in the current framework.Analysis and Reporting:Conduct detailed analyses of simulation results, compare them with experimental data, and document findings in a clear and concise manner.Research Contribution:Contribute to the ongoing research efforts at Thales Belgium by collaborating with physicists and engineers, potentially leading to publications or presentations in scientific conferences.At Thales we provide CAREERS and not only jobs. With Thales employing 80,000 employees in 68 countries our mobility policy enables thousands of employees each year to develop their careers at home and abroad, in their existing areas of expertise or by branching out into new fields.

155,155,Mathematical modeling and analysis for biological rhythms of 12 hours,Inria,"A propos du centre ou de la direction fonctionnelleThe Inria center at UniversitÂ¨Â¦ C?te d'Azur includes 42 research teams and 9 support services. The center's staff (about 500 people) is made up of scientists of di?erent nationalities, engineers, technicians and administrative staff. The teams are mainly located on the university campuses of Sophia Antipolis and Nice as well as Montpellier, in close collaboration with research and higher education laboratories and establishments (UniversitÂ¨Â¦ C?te d'Azur, CNRS, INRAE, INSERM ...), but also with the regional economic players.With a presence in the fields of computational neuroscience and biology, data science and modeling, software engineering and certification, as well as collaborative robotics, the Inria Centre at UniversitÂ¨Â¦ C?te d'Azur is a major player in terms of scientific excellence through its results and collaborations at both European and international levels.Contexte et atouts du posteBiological rhythms are very frequent in living organisms, such as the well known circadian clock which controls a number of genes that are expressed in an oscillatory way, with a period of 24 hours. However, very recently, new rhythms with a period of 12 hours have been identified in the liver of mice [1]. This is the case of a large group of genes that are mostly involved in proteostasis and metabolism and whose expression oscillates with a period of 12 hours. Even though very little is known about these 12 hour rhythmic processes, the protein XBP1 appears to be at the core of a negative feedback loop circuit [2] which may be generating an ultradian rhythm.In general, the 12 hour rhythms have two pics during a whole day, coinciding with the day-to-night and night-to-day transitions, but the first studies indicate that the ultradian rhythms are independent of the circadian rhythm. The goal of this project is to construct a first mathematical model of the XBP1 oscillator, calibrate its parameters from biological data, and analyze the main properties of the model, such as existence and stability of a periodic orbit. Studying the mechanisms of ultradian rhythms, as well as their comparison with circadian rhythms, is important to understand adaptation and evolution of organisms, in particular in the context of certain pathologies.This topic is part of the project OSCILLA12, in the ""Masters EnvironneÂ¨Â¦s"" program at UniversitÂ¨Â¦ C?te d'Azur, in collaboration with the Circadian Systems Biology team of Franck Delaunay and Michele Teboul at Institut de Biology de Valrose, who will be performing experiments connected to the ultradian rhythm. The Master student will thus be integrated in an Inria team with large experience in the modeling and analysis of biological oscillators and will also frequently interact with a team of biologists with expertise in the mammalian circadian clock.Mission confiÂ¨Â¦eA mathematical model using ordinary differential equations will be constructed to describe the circuit involving XBP1, a protein related to the immune system. This circuit has two main elements: first, after transcription, the mRNA Xbp1 may be spliced and give rise to the protein XBP1s which will in turn further promote the transcription of its gene Xbp 1 ; second, the mRNA Xbp1 may be translated directly into the (unspliced) protein XBP1u, which will in turn contribute to the degradation of the (spliced) protein XBP1s. Thus a positive and a negative feedback loop are present in the XBP1 circuit.To describe such a negative feedback loop we will start by using the Goodwin model [3], which is composed of at least three variables (Pi, i=1,2,3) organized in a cascade where P1 positively activates P2, P2 positively activates P3, and finally P3 inhibits P1. The model proposed by Goodwin contains only linear terms, except for the term describing the inhibition of P1 by P3, and represents a basic circuit required for the existence of oscillatory behavior. Starting from this basic model, we will then add other elements, such as the positive feedback loop represented by the spliced protein, and also add new variables to represent other proteins that are known to participate in the XBP1 circuit.The parameters of the mathematical model will then be calibrated by comparison of the model to experimental data from Delaunay team. We will simulate and study the model to show that it has a periodic orbit with a period close to 12 hours. We will also compare the mechanisms of this oscillator with those of a circadian oscillator [4], to detect possible similarities and differences, and identify mechanisms that are more closely related to longer or shorter periods.Principales activitÂ¨Â¦s1. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the 12 hour oscillator system, by application of different techniques.2. Numerical simulations and analysis of the results.3. Writing a report on the project.CompÂ¨Â¦tencesThe candidate should have some knowledge of ordinary di?erential equations and be familiar with a software such as Scilab, Matlab, Phyton, or equivalent.AvantagesSubsidized mealsPartial reimbursement of public transport costsLeave: 7 weeks of annual leave + 10 extra days off due to RTT (statutory reduction in working hours) + possibility of exceptional leave (sick children, moving home, etc.)Possibility of teleworking and flexible organization of working hoursProfessional equipment available (videoconferencing, loan of computer equipment, etc.)Social, cultural and sports events and activitiesAccess to vocational trainingContribution to mutual insurance (subject to conditions)RÂ¨Â¦munÂ¨Â¦rationTraineeship grant depending on attendance hours.",France,0,['collaboration'],,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Teaching and Research

161,161,Monotonous multi-thread programming (with potential PhD continuation),Inria,"Contexte et atouts du posteThis internship takes place in the context of a collaboration with Airbus on the topic of safe and efficient parallelization of critical embedded control software onto multi-cores.Scientific context:Mastering concurrency is difficult, and yet hardware design resolutely moves towards increasingly massive parallelism based on the use of chip-multiprocessors. Threads are one of the major programming paradigms for such multi-/many-core systems. They arguably provide the best portability and the finest control over resource allocation. This explains why threads are the only concurrency model integrated in the C language (as part of the C11 standard revision), which in turn established C11 as the preferred programming model for defining the semantics of low-level shared-memory parallelism, and then for providing mechanized proof apparatus.But the expressiveness of C11 threads comes at a price. As a model of computation, threads are wildly non-deterministic and non-compositional , making both programming and formal analysis difficult. The intrinsic complexity of shared memory parallelism is compounded in C11 by the behavior of weakly-consistent memory models, which is represented at language level to allow the writing of efficient code without resorting to external annotations. As a consequence, C11 allows for counter-intuitive behaviors like the production of out-of-thin-air values . All these reasons explain why multi-threaded software is often bug-ridden even in the context of critical systems .Large, ambitious research projects such as VST (Verified Software Toolchain) or DeepSpec have been enacted to build the methods and the (formal and software) tools supporting the design of correct multi-threaded software. However, while formally-verified software is mostly needed in domain-specific applications, projects such as VST focused on general-purpose concurrency constructs, like semaphores and critical sections. Programming such domain-specific systems with semaphores and critical sections is often inefficient and cumbersome.Our proposal targets a large class of domain-specific applications where concurrency is constrained, providing strong monotony and determinism properties. Such is the case in embedded control, in machine learning, or in automatically-parallelized software... A typical example is that of parallelized avionics software . In this case, the use of low-level, fine-grain synchronization allows achieving both the strict safety guarantees required by the industry and a highly efficient use of various multi-cores (based on Kalray, Power, or ARM architecture).Contact:More information on the internship offer can be obtained by contacting dumitru.potop@inria.fr, jean-marie.madiot@inria.fr, or pierre.courtieu@cnam.fr .Mission confiÂ¨Â¦eAssignments:The objective of this intership is to formally define a restriction of the general C11 concurrency model that exhibits strong monotony and determinism properties. Previous work on our state-of-the-art parallelization toolflow has already identified synchronization primitives and a software organization that support efficient and safe code generation for large-scale avionics applications. This internship will focus on:Formalizing sufficient properties ensuring that the execution of a multi-thread program is monotonous and deterministic (and data race-free, serializable...). These properties must be amenable to low-cost verification by means of static analysis. They will define our monotonous and deterministic sub-set of concurrent C11.Exploring the mechanization of the semantics of our concurrent C11 sub-set in the framework of concurrent separation logic (CSL) while maintaining compatibility with the sequential semantics of CompCert .The developments will be evaluated on parallelized avionics software produced by our state-of-the-art parallellization toolflow.Principales activitÂ¨Â¦sMain activities :State of the art analysisFormalization of the sufficient properties identifying our concurrent C11 sub-set.Exploring the mechanization of the semantics in the framework of CSL.Contributing to writing a paper on the topicCompÂ¨Â¦tencesLanguages : proficiency in either French or EnglishAvantagesSubsidized mealsPartial reimbursement of public transport costsLeave: 7 weeks of annual leave + 10 extra days off due to RTT (statutory reduction in working hours) + possibility of exceptional leave (sick children, moving home, etc.)Possibility of teleworking and flexible organization of working hoursProfessional equipment available (videoconferencing, loan of computer equipment, etc.)Social, cultural and sports events and activitiesAccess to vocational trainingSocial security coverage",France,0,['collaboration'],,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Teaching and Research

169,169,Embedded Machine Learning Programming (with potential PhD continuation),Inria,"Contexte et atouts du posteThis internship takes place in the context of a collaboration with the ASTRA joint Inria/Valeo team and with Google DeepMind on the topic of modeling and efficient implementation of complex Machine Learning applications onto embedded platforms.Scientific context:Conventional machine learning (ML) frameworks offer a tensor-centric view of the design and implementation of deep neural networks. But ML models do not stand by themselves as pure tensor functions. ML applications typically interact with an environment and often operate on stream of data collected and processed over time. For instance, the reactive control of a self-driving car operates on streams of data coming from sensors and controlling actuators. Training algorithms themselves embed a model into a reactive loop, itself decomposed into epochs and (mini- )batches allowing the efficient scheduling of computations and I/O, parameter updates, etc. The same applies to reinforcement learning (RL) agents . Back to the automated driving example, stateful behavior is essential to taking into account previously-inferred facts such as speed limits, whether the current lane is a left turn etc., long after the acquisition of sensor inputs. Other examples of ML components embedded into stateful reactive feedback loops include model-predictive maintenance , control , and digital twins . ML models themselves involve stateful constructs in the form of recurrent neural network (RNN) layers. When generating optimized code, even matrix products and convolutions in feedforward networks can be folded over time, using (stateful) buffering to reduce memory footprint . In distributed settings, the efficient implementation of large models involves pipelined communications and computations , which amounts to locally recovering a streaming execution pattern.Considering this broad range of scenarios, we observe that existing ML frameworks inadequately capture reactive aspects, raising barriers between differentiable models and the associated control, optimization, and input/output code. These barriers worsen the gap between ML research and system capabilities , particularly in the area of control automation where embedded ML engineering relies on undisclosed, ad-hoc implementations .In previous work, we have proposed a reactive language, named MLR , integrating ML-specific constructs (such as bidirectional recurrences or the tensorial operations) and activities (such as automatic differentiation). We have also shown that for applications without bidirectional recurrences reactiveness does not penalize performance .Mission confiÂ¨Â¦eThe objective of this internship and of the potential PhD follow-up is to advance on either, or both the MLR language design and the MLR compilation fronts.On the language design (syntax and semantics) side, of particular interest is the introduction of iterators allowing for seamless conversion of iterations performed in time, on streams, into iterations performed in space, on tensors. Such transformations are needed both at high level, e.g. to introduce a ""batch"" dimension into a computation, and at low level, e.g. to specify how a large tensorial operation is decomposed for execution onto hardware.On the compilation side, the key difficulty is the handling of bidirectional recurrences. Classical reactive formalisms such as Lustre can be compiled into very efficient, statically-scheduled code running in constant memory, without buffering. By comparison, the ML-specific bidirectional recurrences implicitly require buffering and dynamic scheduling (like the tape-based methods used during training). Replacing this implicit buffering with explicit, efficient and bounded buffering under a mostly-static scheduling has the potential to largely improve the performance and predictibility of generated code.In both cases, the internship will start with the analysis and MLR modeling of a complex ML application that will be used as main use case: a Reinforcement Learning-based Autonomous Driving (AD) application from the automotive domain.The internship will involve regular interactions with:Google DeepMind for the language design and compilation work.Our automotive partners (the ASTRA team and Valeo) for the evaluation of MLR on the AD use case.Contact:More information on the internship offer can be obtained by contacting dumitru.potop@inria.frPrincipales activitÂ¨Â¦sMain activities :State of the art analysisUse case modeling and evaluationProposal of language extensions and compilation methodsParticipating to the writing of a research paperCompÂ¨Â¦tencesLanguages : Proficiency in either French or English is required.AvantagesSubsidized mealsPartial reimbursement of public transport costsLeave: 7 weeks of annual leave + 10 extra days off due to RTT (statutory reduction in working hours) + possibility of exceptional leave (sick children, moving home, etc.)Possibility of teleworkingProfessional equipment available (videoconferencing, loan of computer equipment, etc.)Social, cultural and sports events and activitiesAccess to vocational trainingSocial security coverage",France,0,['collaboration'],,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Teaching and Research

38 gemeenten, Openbaar Ministerie en politie van de regio Midden-Nederland hebben afgesproken de krachten effectief te bundelen. Hun doelen staan in de Veiligheidsstrategie 2023 Ã¢Â?2026 beschreven. Bureau Regionale Veiligheidsstrategie (RVS) faciliteert de veiligheidspartners bij het bereiken van deze doelen. Het is onze missie om onze partners te helpen excelleren. Het Regionaal informatie en expertisecentrum Midden-Nederland (RIEC MN) bundelt de krachten om de georganiseerde ondermijnende drugscriminaliteit een halt toe te roepen.

Help jij ons om cijfers en data over de regio Midden-Nederland inzichtelijk en bruikbaar te krijgen?

Cijfers, informatie en kennis helpen onze partners om keuzes te maken om onze maatschappij veilig te maken en houden. Hiervoor zoeken wij een nieuwe collega bij team Informatiewerk van Bureau RVS en het RIEC Midden-Nederland. De Veiligheidscoalitie MN maakt voor haar eigen informatiebehoefte en die van de regionale veiligheidspartners gebruik van online gegevensdashboards. Deze worden in SWING en Tableau ontwikkeld, beheerd en onderhouden door het team informatiewerk. Als data analist voor het team Informatiewerk van het RIEC MN en Bureau RVS zorg jij voor het verwerken, ontsluiten, ordenen, analyseren en visualiseren van diverse databronnen. Ook weet je de resultaten van je werk begrijpelijk en overtuigend te presenteren en bruikbaar te maken voor diverse doelgroepen, zoals medewerkers van gemeenten en politie, en interne collegaÃ¢ÂÂs binnen bureau RVS en het RIEC. Je bent nieuwsgierig naar de mogelijkheden van nieuwe databronnen en ziet mogelijkheden deze binnen de wettelijke kaders te ontsluiten en te benutten. We doen de dataverwerking met tools die tot onze beschikking staan; onder andere SPSS, FME, R en ArcGis(let op geen Python). De verschillende databronnen worden veilig bewaard in een Oracle Database. Jij draagt bij aan het inrichten en onderhouden van deze database.

Zowel bureau RVS als het RIEC Midden-Nederland werken met veel partners samen. Jij vindt het leuk om te werken in een omgeving met verschillende organisaties met allemaal hun eigen informatieregimes en uitdagingen. Je vindt het belangrijk om te zorgen dat we op een rechtmatige manier de mogelijkheden van de AVG en het RIEC-convenant benutten.

Medewerkers uit de hele organisatie kunnen een beroep op je doen. Je vindt het leuk om met andere onderzoekers samen te werken, maar zelfstandig en alleen werken gaat je ook goed af. Je bent toegankelijk, pragmatisch, flexibel en analytisch en je bent in staat om je communicatief goed uit te drukken. Je deinst niet terug voor veel eigen verantwoordelijkheid en een veelheid aan onderwerpen en activiteiten. Belangrijk is dat jij denkt in kansen en mogelijkheden!

Taken en werkzaamheden

Je houdt je bezig met het onderhouden en (door)ontwikkelen van diverse online gegevensdashboards in SWING en Tableau, waar de Veiligheidscoalitie Midden-Nederland gebruik van maakt. Hierbij hoort het verkennen en gebruik maken van nieuwe mogelijkheden om onze partners laagdrempeliger inzicht te geven in verschillende databronnen (bijvoorbeeld door de onderdelen MosaÃÂ¯c en Stories in SWING te gebruiken);
Je houdt je bezig met het (her)inrichten en het gebruik (beheer) van de Oracle Database;
Je stemt veelvuldig af met de andere twee kwantitatieve onderzoekers over de inhoud, opzet en planning van dataontsluiting;
Je bent eerste aanspreekpunt (en functioneel beheerder) voor partners over het gebruik van verschillende databronnen zoals het Tableau dashboard;
Je haalt feedback op van partners over het gebruik;
Je werkzaamheden zijn zowel van toegevoegde waarde voor het RIEC als voor Bureau RVS.

Wat wij vragen

Minimaal een afgeronde, relevante Hbo-opleiding en 4 jaar werkervaring in bijvoorbeeld een onderzoeks- of (data)analysefunctie;
Ruime ervaring met het ontsluiten van databronnen middels diverse tools en het verwerken van kwantitatieve onderzoeksgegevens. Je bent bekend met ETL-processen en SQL en tools als Excel, SPSS, FME, en Tableau;
Toegepaste kennis van SWING, Tableau Server, FME Server en Oracle is een pre;
Je werkt gestructureerd en planmatig. Werken onder tijdsdruk is geen probleem voor je;
Je bent zowel in staat om (intensief) samen als zelfstandig te werken. Als teamspeler draag je bij aan de binding en ontwikkeling van team informatiewerk;
Je beschikt over bestuurlijke sensitiviteit en geduld voor bestuurlijke (besluitvormings)processen;
Inzicht in het werkveld en de werkprocessen van gemeenten, politie, het Openbaar Ministerie en de Belastingdienst is een pre;
Kennis van de themaÃ¢ÂÂs en onderwerpen uit de Veiligheidsstrategie is een pre;
Je spreekt en schrijft vloeiend Nederlands.

This is Allego

Allego is the leading company for fast and ultra-fast charging solutions to companies and consumers throughout Europe. We deliver charging facilities ranging from regular home charging to state-of-the-art high power charging that can be used by all electric cars and every EV driver, providing a seamless charging experience. Our goal is to contribute to zero emission mobility and allow EV drivers to charge at the right place with the right speed. The EV market is emerging and changing rapidly. With our proven track record and long experience, we keep driving forward with confidence.

A Bit More About The Job

We are looking for a new team member to join our Network Planning team, which is located in Berlin (DE). The Network Planning team is responsible for determining the right location for the right type of charger to support investment decisions for infrastructure expansion and to reach our goal of clean mobility.

You do this through the evaluation of potential charging locations based on spatial, demographical and strategic factors and convert this into a business case. With your analyses you play a pivot role in the investment decisions for expansion of our network.

Of course you wonÃ¢ÂÂt do this alone. You will be a part of a dynamic international team. They will help you to get up to speed within Allego, but hopefully you can teach them a thing or two yourself, because a fresh pair of eyes always sees new things. The Network Planning team collaborates closely with related departments within Allego like Sales, Finance and Product Development. So you will operate in an international environment with colleagues from all over Europe.

Since Allego is one of the main players in this new and growing industry, you will be able to shape the future of transport and build the charging infrastructure of the future!

Requirements

You are eager to learn, highly self-motivated, and excited to work in the highly innovative and international sector of sustainable mobility!

As our ideal candidate:

You have at least 2 years experience in an analytics and/or e-mobility related position.
You combine your experience in data analysis with at least basic experience in geodata processing and/or business case modeling.
Excel has no secrets for you. If you have knowledge of Power BI or GIS (QGIS), we will be very happy.
You have affinity towards the EV and charging industry.
You are able to independently manage multiple projects simultaneously.
Your excellent communication skills enable you to connect and collaborate with multiple internal stakeholders.

As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.

We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerceÃ¢Â? to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.

As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.

At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.

About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.

The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.

We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:

A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head.We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. WeÃ¢ÂÂre looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a Ã¢ÂÂhands onÃ¢Â?attitude.

De organisatie De Koninklijke Marechaussee

De Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar) is een politieorganisatie met militaire status en wordt beheerd door de minister van Defensie. Ze is een van de vier krijgsmachtdelen van de Nederlandse krijgsmacht. Vanwege de specifieke taak valt de KMar, in tegenstelling tot de zee-, land- en luchtstrijdkrachten, niet onder direct bevel van de Commandant der Strijdkrachten. Behalve wanneer de KMar in het buitenland wordt ingezet voor andere taken dan de politietaak ten aanzien van militairen.

Het Commando Koninklijke Marechaussee (CKMar) voert politietaken uit op grond van de Politiewet (PW) 2012. De taken worden zowel nationaal als internationaal en tijdens missies uitgevoerd. Daarnaast levert het CKMar capaciteit aan de Commandant der Strijdkrachten voor deelname aan (militaire) missies, waarbij het CKMar andere taken uitvoert dan die in de PW zijn opgedragen.

De KMar waakt over de veiligheid van de Staat. In Nederland en ver daarbuiten. Ze wordt wereldwijd ingezet op plaatsen van strategisch belang. Van de koninklijke paleizen tot aan de buitengrenzen van Europa. Van luchthavens in Nederland tot oorlogs- en crisisgebieden overal ter wereld. De KMar is veelzijdig inzetbaar voor veiligheid, juist als het erop aankomt.

De afdeling Cluster Informatievoorziening

De werkzaamheden vinden plaats binnen het Cluster IV. De kern van het werken met informatie is om de Koninklijke Marechaussee dÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡r te brengen waar het eropaan komt, zodat we zo goed mogelijk het effect kunnen hebben dat van ons verwacht wordt: zorgen voor de veiligheid van de Staat. Informatie is daarvoor de basis. Een goed overzicht en inzicht van alle datadomeinen binnen Koninklijke Marechaussee is hiervoor cruciaal. Alle werkzaamheden ten aanzien van de functionaliteit en informatiebeheer van het systeemlandschap vinden plaats binnen het cluster.

DATA ANALIST Ã¢Â?startersfunctie

Kom jij net van hogeschool of universiteit en heb je zin om in de praktijk echt met data aan de slag te gaan, dan hebben we voor jou de juiste functie! Bij Whooz helpen we in een team met specialisten elke dag onze klanten om met data antwoorden te geven op marketing- en locatievraagstukken.

Dus puzzel jij graag met veel data en creÃÂ«er je graag waarde voor onze klanten door data om te zetten naar inzichten? Dan ben jij wellicht degene die we zoeken.

Wat we bieden is een mooie functie waarbij je data bewerkt en analyseert om vervolgens waardevolle inzichten te creÃÂ«ren voor onze klanten. Niet de data, de tool of de methodologie staat voorop, maar de toepassing van de klant! Stap voor stap begeleiden we jou op een informele manier, zodat je leert hoe jouw analytische skills waarde brengen aan de hand van concrete vraagstukken binnen klantanalyse, -werving en -behoud.

Al snel voer je in het team van analisten zelfstandig en in teamverband analyses uit voor onze opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast doe je dataleveringen aan licentieklanten en ondersteun je onze klanten in het vinden van waarde in data. Je bent nauwkeurig en analytisch en vindt het leuk om concreet aan de slag te zijn met data en klanten.

We snappen dat je wellicht nog niet 100% weet wat je wil voor de rest van de carriÃÂ¨re en daarom is er binnen Whooz altijd ruimte om aan de hand van je interesse en/of nieuwe vragen uit de markt nieuwe technieken te proberen en nieuwe toepassingen te ontwikkelen. Bijvoorbeeld door een nieuwe manier en/of vorm te bedenken waarop we inzichten generen voor onze klanten of door mee te werken aan de ontwikkeling van een nieuw product.

Het allerbelangrijkste voor ons is dat je echt enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en dat je altijd nieuwsgierig bent naar nieuwe inzichten. Aangezien veel van onze klanten werken in het marketingveld is het fijn als je affiniteit hebt met (online) marketingtoepassingen. Vanzelfsprekend ben je veel met data in de weer, maar je schroomt niet om aan de klant je gevonden inzichten te presenteren, je advies toe te lichten en proactief met hem mee te denken.

Wat bieden we

Onze medewerkers vinden het fijn dat er een informele sfeer en open cultuur heerst binnen Whooz, waarbij we binnen het team samen de klant helpen en onze doelen behalen. Ook is er altijd ruimte voor eigen inzicht en ideeÃÂ«n. Ben je een beetje eigenwijs? Helemaal goed want dat zijn wij ook. We bieden een marktconform salaris en bieden je ruimte om je binnen je werk te ontwikkelen. De meeste dagen werken we met elkaar op ons ruime kantoor nabij het centrum van Den Haag, maar er is zeker ook ruimte en flexibiliteit om een deel van de dagen thuis te werken.

Functie-eisen

Naast dat iemand met HBO/WO werk- en denkniveau zoeken, vinden we het belangrijkste voor deze functie is, dat je iedere keer weer enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en de mogelijkheden die deze bieden voor organisaties. Vanzelfsprekend is het wenselijk dat je beschikt over analytische vaardigheden (statistiek, clustering, modellering, dashboarding) en datamanagement vaardigheden (dataprocessen inrichten en runnen). Kennis van het toepassen van technieken, zoals web scraping en artificiÃÂ«le intelligentie, voor het verzamelen en genereren van data is een prÃÂ©. Je bent daarnaast servicegericht, professioneel, zelfbewust, communicatief vaardig en kunt zelfstandig, maar ook samen werken. Voor communicatie met onze klanten is een goede beheersing van de Nederlandse taal een must.

Ben jij de oplossingsgerichte dataliefhebber die wij zoeken? Neem dan contact met ons op. Je kunt je motivatie en CV sturen naar info@whooz.nl t.a.v. Peter.

436,436,Data Analyst,Belfius,"Omschrijving

Bij Belfius geloven we dat data de basis vormen van onze digitale transformatie. Of het nu gaat om digitale marketing, het leveren van producten en diensten op maat, het nemen van tactische en strategische beslissingen, het verbeteren van de procedures of het monitoren van onze prestaties, data spelen in dat verband een cruciale rol.

Elke dag opnieuw vinden miljoenen verrichtingen plaats in de systemen van Belfius, wat telkens data oplevert. In het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team moeten wij die gegevens begrijpen en ze vertalen in insights en tools ontwikkelen ter ondersteuning van de beslissingen en de strategie van de metiers.

De job in een notendop

Wij zijn op zoek naar iemand die ons kan ondersteunen in onze activiteiten inzake reporting en kwaliteitscontrole. In die functie hebt jij twee expertisedomeinen:

producten die provisieloon opleveren (rekeningen, fondsen, beleggingen enz.)
de kosten, en dat voor alle activiteiten van de bank

In die context krijg jij twee hoofdtaken toebedeeld. Aan de ene kant voer je analyses uit van de maandelijkse resultaten en zorg jij ervoor dat die de nodige kwaliteit hebben. Je stelt je analyses eveneens ter beschikking van de diverse stakeholders zodat zij hun beslissingen kunnen nemen. Aan de andere kant bekommer jij je eveneens om de follow-up van de evoluties in het domein (impact op de berekening van de rentabiliteit bij de lancering van nieuwe producten, het veranderen van tariefstructuur enz.) om de potentiÃÂ«le impact op onze activiteiten te analyseren.

Binnen de afdeling Data & Analytics maakt het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team deel uit van Data Transformation Risk & ICM en is het verantwoordelijk voor het exploiteren van de data van het domein Risk & ICM voor het berekenen van de rentabiliteit en de positie van de risicoÃ¢ÂÂs van de klanten, segmenten, producten, metiers enz. Het team identificeert transversaal en gecentraliseerd de behoeften van de diverse betrokken partijen in termen van de visualisering en architectuur en is verantwoordelijk voor diverse taken:

ontwikkeling van cockpits: visualisering van het financieel/commercieel rendement en van de positie van Risk voor de segmenten/klanten/producten
verslagen opstellen en bestaande verslagen automatiseren: die worden opgesteld op basis van definities afkomstig uit geharmoniseerde gegevensbronnen
ad-hocanalyses: bijvoorbeeld op een categorie van klanten, een bepaald product enz

De afdeling omvat multifunctionele teams met o.m. data engineers en data analysts.

De Data Analyst is in de eerste plaats een aanspreekpunt in het domein van de kosten en de provisielonen en de aanwending van de gegevens daarrond.

De Data Analyst maakt deel uit van de Data Visualisation community en bepaalt en deelt in die hoedanigheid de best practices op het gebied van datavisualisatie.

Jij hoeft geen witte raaf te zijn

Al kan je er bij ons wel ÃÂ©ÃÂ©n worden. We zoeken vooral een straffe persoonlijkheid met een learning mindset.

Bij ons mag je volop je vleugels uitslaan als je iemand bent met:

een voorliefde voor cijfers en een sterke analytische capaciteiten
een gezonde dosis nieuwsgierigheid en een interesse in business en marketing concepten
sterke communicatievaardigheden

oog voor detail en datanuances
het vermogen om een massa aan gegevens samen te vatten en om te zetten in kerninzichten

Belfius koestert zijn talenten

Een mooi loon net als de mogelijkheid om een Flex-budget samen te stellen dat je kan besteden volgens je voorkeuren (bv. wagen, fiets, pc, smartphone, tablet) en extralegale voordelen zoals maaltijdcheques, personeelsvoordeel op eigen producten en diensten, en een hospitalisatie- en groepsverzekering.
